<Description>
For advanced users, this forked version of the original program adds a selectable method to pre-clear Unraid disks (within nwipe), while keeping the rest of the functionality consistent with the original. nwipe is a program that will securely erase the entire contents of disks, with a ncurses GUI. It can help you make sure that your precious data is gone for good, before you sell or RMA your disks. nwipe is a fork of the dwipe command originally used by Darik's Boot and Nuke (DBAN).
